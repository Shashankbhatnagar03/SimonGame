## How to Play

When the game starts, the Simon Game will play a sequence of colored buttons. The player must then repeat the sequence by clicking on the buttons in the correct order. Each time the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game will add another random button to the end of the sequence. If the player makes a mistake, the game will end and the player will have to start over from the beginning.

To play the game, simply open the 'index.html' file in your web browser. The game will automatically start when the page loads.
